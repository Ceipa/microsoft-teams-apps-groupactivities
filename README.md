## Group Activities App Template

For organizations including education institutions, there is often a need to create and collaborate in a group activity. Often, the process of creating and managing the groups and the collaboration around it takes more time than the activity itself. Group activities app makes it easy to quickly create groups for group activities along with providing an easy workflow to manage the collaboration all within the familiar context of Microsoft Teams canvas.
 
Without Group Activities app, it would involve first doing the pairing manually, then going and creating the channels (or letting team members figure their own collaboration environment) and finally adding users to such private channels.

Using the  app in Microsoft Teams, activity authors will have the ability to create assignments or activities and distribute the team members in a team/class in randomized groups depending on the grouping criteria and create Standard or Private channels for each of those groups that enables members to have their own workspace for collaboration. The activity author will be added to all standard channels created by the app.

The grouping criteria consists of two options
 - Create groups by dividing into equal number of team members in each group
 - Create groups by dividing team members into number of groups specified

While creating a group activity, activity authors will also have the option to select if they would like the app to send reminders until each activity is scheduled to be completed. The app will send 2 reminders daily at 10 AM and 5 PM until the due date of the activity.
